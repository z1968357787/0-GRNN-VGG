        "nlq": "There is a defect of small scratches located at the mid-mid of the image,problem:Impact on product quality: Scratch defects can cause indentations or protrusions on the surface of the strip steel, reducing the aesthetics of the product and affecting its market competitiveness.\n,solution:Improve lubrication management: Select and use suitable rolling lubricants, ensuring good lubrication effect to reduce friction and wear, thus minimizing the occurrence of scratch defects.\n\nThere is a defect of small scratches located at the mid-mid of the image,problem:Impact on product quality: Scratch defects can cause indentations or protrusions on the surface of the strip steel, reducing the aesthetics of the product and affecting its market competitiveness.\n,solution:Enhance quality control: Establish a sound quality control system, strengthen inspection of raw materials and finished products, promptly identify and address scratch defect issues, and ensure product compliance and stability.\n\nThere is a defect of small inclusion located at the left-mid of the image,problem:Impaired processability: Inclusions reduce the processability of hot-rolled strip steel, leading to issues such as cutting edge wear, tool breakage, and scratches. This poses challenges for subsequent processes like machining, cold deformation, and welding, increasing production costs and reducing product quality.,solution:Strengthen smelting and casting process control: Reduce the generation of inclusions by properly controlling furnace temperature, furnace cycles, and smelting processes. Additionally, design casting processes effectively, controlling casting speed and cooling rate to minimize inclusion formation.\n\n"
