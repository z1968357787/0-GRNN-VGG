        "nlq": "There is a defect of small inclusion located at the mid-mid of the image,problem:Decreased product quality: Inclusions affect the surface quality and overall appearance of hot-rolled strip steel, resulting in rough surfaces, unevenness, or color variations. These surface defects diminish the aesthetic appeal of the strip steel, which is particularly significant in applications with specific requirements such as automotive manufacturing and appliance production.\n,solution:Enhance rolling process control: Strengthen dynamic monitoring and control during the rolling process to promptly detect and address inclusion defects. Adjust rolling temperature, rolling speed, and rolling schemes to minimize inclusion diffusion and damage.\n\nThere is a defect of small inclusion located at the mid-lower of the image,problem:Impaired processability: Inclusions reduce the processability of hot-rolled strip steel, leading to issues such as cutting edge wear, tool breakage, and scratches. This poses challenges for subsequent processes like machining, cold deformation, and welding, increasing production costs and reducing product quality.,solution:Strengthen quality management and training: Establish strict quality management systems, and provide comprehensive training to operators to enhance their understanding and handling capabilities regarding inclusion defects.\n"
